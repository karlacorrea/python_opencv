The Gabor filter is a widely used image processing filter for detecting edges and textures in an image. It is commonly used in computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. Automating image handling using the Gabor filter can be done using a script in a suitable programming language such as Python.
This is an example of how you can automate image handling using the Gabor filter with a Python script, using an OpenCV library
